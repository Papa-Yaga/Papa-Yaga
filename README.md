* In my past i have gathered first experience at analysing data at Fidor Bank.
* Extremely interested in using data as a way of influencing decisions

My Skillset is as following:

* Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow)
* SQL (MySQL)
* Tableau
* Jupyter Notebook
* EDA
* Machine Learning
* Agile Scrum Methodology
* Documentation and Presentation

## My favorite Projects:

[Neural Network to recognize greek letters](https://github.com/Papa-Yaga/Ironhack_Projects/tree/main/Project_7_Neural_Net)
* In this project I will be applying deep learning models to create an image recognition system that can read near unreadable letters of old greek on papyrus. With a custom built layered model we hope to be able to read out words and letters on otherwise unreadable scrolls if papyrus.
[Machine Learning project to identify toxic mushrooms](https://github.com/Papa-Yaga/Ironhack_Projects/tree/main/Project_6_Machine_Learning)
* In this project we have applied KNNeighbors and DecisionTreeClassifier to identify potentially toxic mushrooms.
